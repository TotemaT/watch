Android app to search and save movies.

This app is mainly done to experiment with new libraries and stuff. It thus uses :

- [OMDd API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) to get infos about movies in JSON
- [Butter Knife](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife) to bind views and methods
- [Picasso](https://github.com/square/picasso) to download and cache pictures
