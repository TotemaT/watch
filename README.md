Android app to search and save movies.

This app is mainly done to experiment with new libraries and stuff. It uses :

- [OMDd API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) to get infos about movies in JSON
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) to handle HTTP requests
- [Butter Knife](https://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/) to bind views and methods
- [Picasso](https://square.github.io/picasso/) to download and cache pictures

The app is far from done, but I learnt what I wanted to from this project.
I most likely won't work on it anymore, so feel free to use it in any way you want :)
